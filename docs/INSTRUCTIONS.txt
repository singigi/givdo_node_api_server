In this folder, you will find the API documentation, as well as an ER diagram showing the database structure (as of 7/4/18). There is a Postman
collection containing examples of how to use each individual API call. 

To begin working with the server, you should do the following:

1. Set up your database and server by following the instructions in the server repo (https://github.com/Givdo/givdo_node_api_server)
2. Install a database visualizer program like Sequel Pro (https://www.sequelpro.com/), and create a connection for the givdo-development database
3. Install the Postman API development environment (https://www.getpostman.com/)
4. Import the provided postmand collection in this folder into Postman. To do this, open Postman and choose Preferences in the dropdown menu 
    (on a Mac this is found by selectin Postman > Preferences, but on Windows it is different). A preferences window will open. Go to the tab 
    marked "Data." Then choose "Import Data" and select the postman collection file from your drive. A screenshot of the relevant menu is 
    also provided in this folder. 
5. When the collection is imported, it will show up on in the left pane of your Postman workspace. From there, you can browse individual calls 
    and run any one you want. You can understand the CRUD operations by running the calls in Postmand and viewing the results in Sequel Pro.
